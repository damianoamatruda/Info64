Getting Started
---------------
To program the editor you'll need to know C#.
If you want to get this editor running on a Windows machine, you'll need to have the latest version of [__Visual Studio__](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/).

Contributing
------------
If you want to help developing the editor there are a few things you'll need to:
*   __Comment Everything__ - Comments help everyone understand what you did, how, and why.  Please try to leave useful comments and keep with the commenting style of the rest of the project.
*   __Create Issues__ - If you find a bug, or if you have an idea for a feature, please create a GitHub Issue for it.  This will help us keep track of everything that has to be maintained and to evolve the project.
*   __Update Documentation__ - If you find an area of the documentation that is hard to follow or is misleading please add to or refine the document.  Also make sure to update documentation for anything you change or add.
*   __Keep Simple Codes__ - Simple code is preferred over complex and convoluted code.  This is simple to follow, meaningful names for variables and functions. Write codes as small as possible. We prefer the shortcuts.
